1. Basic Operations with LinkedHashSet
   Write a program to:
   - Add elements to a LinkedHashSet.
   - Remove elements.
   - Iterate over the set to print all elements in insertion order.

2. Remove Duplicates from an Array
   Given an array of integers, write a program to remove all duplicates and retain the order of elements using a LinkedHashSet.

3. Intersection of Two Sets
   Write a program to find the intersection of two LinkedHashSets (i.e., elements that are common to both sets).

4. Union of Two Sets
   Given two LinkedHashSets, write a program to find the union (i.e., all unique elements from both sets).

5. Difference of Two Sets
   Write a program to find the difference between two LinkedHashSets (i.e., elements present in the first set but not in the second).

6. First Non-Repeated Character in a String
   Write a program to find the first non-repeated character in a string using a LinkedHashSet. Iterate through the string, store characters in the set, and remove duplicates.

7. Word Count with LinkedHashSet
   Given a paragraph, write a program to count the number of unique words, maintaining the insertion order using LinkedHashSet.

8. Reverse Elements Using LinkedHashSet
   Write a program to reverse the order of elements in a LinkedHashSet by adding them to a list and printing them in reverse order.

9. Convert LinkedHashSet to Array
   Write a program to convert a LinkedHashSet of strings into an array and print the array.

10. Subset Check
   Given two LinkedHashSets, write a program to check if the first set is a subset of the second set.
