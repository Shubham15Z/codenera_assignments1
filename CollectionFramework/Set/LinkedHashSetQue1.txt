3.Check if a specific element exists in a LinkedHashSet.

4.Remove an element from a LinkedHashSet and display the result.

5.Clear all elements from a LinkedHashSet.


6.Iterate through a LinkedHashSet using both for-each loop and iterator.

7.Create a LinkedHashSet and prevent duplicate values from being inserted. Show with an example.

8.Add elements from an array into a LinkedHashSet and print the set.



9.Given a list of numbers with duplicates, use a LinkedHashSet to remove duplicates and maintain insertion order.

10.Implement a method that accepts a List<String> and returns a LinkedHashSet<String> with duplicates removed.

11.Create a LinkedHashSet and sort its elements using a List.

12.Merge two LinkedHashSets into a third set and display the result without duplicates.
