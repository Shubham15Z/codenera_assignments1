1. Basic Operations with ArrayDeque
   Write a program to perform the following operations using ArrayDeque:
   - Add elements to the front and back of the deque.
   - Remove elements from both ends.
   - Print the final state of the deque.

 2. Palindrome Check
   Write a program to check if a given string is a palindrome using ArrayDeque. Use the deque to compare characters from the front and back.

 3. Reverse a List
   Given a list of integers, use ArrayDeque to reverse the elements and print the reversed list.

 4. Balanced Parentheses
   Write a program that checks whether a string of parentheses (i.e., (), {}, []) is balanced using ArrayDeque.

 6. Max Element in ArrayDeque
   Given an array of integers and a window size k, use ArrayDeque to find the maximum element in.

 8. First Non-Repeated Character
   Write a program to find the first non-repeated character in a string using ArrayDeque for character traversal.

 9. Last n Elements
   Create a program where you continuously add elements to the deque but only retain the last n elements. Print the deque after each insertion.

 10. Merge Two Deques
   Given two deques of integers, merge them into a single deque, keeping the elements in order. Use ArrayDeque to perform this merging.
