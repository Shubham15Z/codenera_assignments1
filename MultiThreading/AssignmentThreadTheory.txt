1. What is multithreading, and why is it important in Java?

Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU. Each part of such program is called a thread. So, threads are light-weight processes within a process.

Threads can be created by using two mechanisms : 

1.Extending the Thread class 
2.Implementing the Runnable Interface

Thread creation by extending the Thread class
We create a class that extends the java.lang.Thread class. This class overrides the run() method available in the Thread class. A thread begins its life inside run() method. We create an object of our new class and call start() method to start the execution of a thread. Start() invokes the run() method on the Thread object.


important

1. Efficient CPU Utilization
Java programs can perform multiple tasks in parallel, making full use of multi-core processors.

Idle CPU time is minimized.

2. Enhanced Application Performance
Tasks like file I/O, data processing, or network calls can be run in separate threads.

The main program doesn't wait — it stays responsive.

3. Better User Experience
In GUI applications (like Swing or JavaFX), multithreading keeps the UI responsive while background tasks (e.g., loading data) run separately.

4. Simplified Asynchronous Programming
Java provides thread management APIs, Executors, and high-level concurrency tools (Callable, Future, CompletableFuture) to simplify asynchronous programming.

5. Real-World Scenarios
Games, real-time monitoring systems, chat servers, and web servers all rely on multithreading for performance and scalability.

3. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of multithreading.


Advantages:

Improved performance: Multithreading can help increase the overall performance of an application, especially on systems with multiple processors or cores. It allows multiple tasks to run concurrently, utilizing the available CPU resources more efficiently.

Responsiveness: In a single-threaded environment, if a long-running task blocks the main thread, the entire application becomes unresponsive. Multithreading can prevent this issue by running such tasks in separate threads, ensuring the application remains responsive.

Better resource utilization: Multithreading allows better utilization of system resources by keeping the CPU busy while waiting for I/O operations or other tasks to complete.

Simplified modeling: Some problems can be more naturally modeled using multiple threads. This makes the program easier to design, understand, and maintain.

Parallelism: Multithreading enables parallelism, which can lead to significant performance improvements in applications that can be divided into smaller, independent tasks.

Disadvantages:

Complexity: Multithreading adds complexity to the program, making it more difficult to design, implement, and debug. Developers need to be aware of synchronization, deadlocks, race conditions, and other concurrency-related issues.

Synchronization overhead: To avoid data corruption and maintain consistency, developers must synchronize access to shared resources, which can result in additional overhead and reduced performance.

Context switching: Context switching between threads consumes CPU time and resources, which can lead to performance degradation if not managed efficiently.

Hard to predict behavior: Due to the concurrent nature of multithreading, the behavior of the program can be hard to predict and reproduce, especially when it comes to debugging.

Limited by hardware: The performance benefits of multithreading are limited by the number of available cores or processors in the system. In some cases, excessive use of threads can lead to performance degradation instead of improvement.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

4. How does multithreading improve the performance of a program?

Multithreading improves program performance by enabling concurrent execution of tasks, allowing the CPU to be utilized more efficiently, especially when dealing with I/O-bound operations or complex computations, and enhancing responsiveness in applications. 

Concurrency:
Multithreading allows a program to perform multiple tasks seemingly at the same time, unlike single-threaded programs that execute tasks sequentially. 

Improved CPU Utilization:
While one thread waits for an I/O operation (like reading from a disk or network), other threads can continue executing, preventing the CPU from idling. 

Enhanced Responsiveness:
In applications with user interfaces, multithreading allows background tasks to run without freezing the main application, leading to a more responsive user experience. 

Resource Sharing:
Threads within the same process share resources like memory, which reduces overhead compared to inter-process communication, leading to faster execution. 

Parallelism:
Multithreading can be used to implement parallelized algorithms, breaking down complex tasks into smaller, independent units that can be executed concurrently, leading to faster overall execution time. 

Simplified Code (in some cases):
By separating tasks into threads, code can become easier to manage and understand, especially for complex applications. 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

5. What is a thread in Java, and how is it different from a process?

Threads are lightweight subprocesses, representing the smallest unit of execution with separate paths. The main advantage of multiple threads is efficiency (allowing multiple things at the same time). For example, in MS Word, one thread automatically formats the document while another thread is taking user input. Additionally, multithreading ensures quick response, as other threads can continue execution even if one gets stuck, keeping the application responsive.


Processes:

Definition:
A process is a program in execution, including code, data, and resources (e.g., files, memory). 

Resource Isolation:
Processes have their own separate memory space and resources, isolating them from other processes. 

Independent Execution:
Processes can run independently of each other, and the OS manages the execution of multiple processes concurrently. 

Example:
Opening multiple applications (e.g., a word processor, a web browser, and a music player) each represents a different process. 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

6. Explain the life cycle of a thread in Java.

A thread in Java can exist in any one of the following states at any given time. A thread lies only in one of the shown states at any instant:

New State
Runnable State
Blocked State
Waiting State
Timed Waiting State
Terminated State


Life Cycle of a Thread 
There are multiple states of the thread in a lifecycle as mentioned below:

New Thread: When a new thread is created, it is in the new state. The thread has not yet started to run when the thread is in this state. When a thread lies in the new state, its code is yet to be run and hasn’t started to execute.

Runnable State: A thread that is ready to run is moved to a runnable state. In this state, a thread might actually be running or it might be ready to run at any instant of time. It is the responsibility of the thread scheduler to give the thread, time to run. A multi-threaded program allocates a fixed amount of time to each individual thread. Each and every thread get a small amount of time to run. After running for a while, a thread pauses and gives up the CPU so that other threads can run.

Blocked: The thread will be in blocked state when it is trying to acquire a lock but currently the lock is acquired by the other thread. The thread will move from the blocked state to runnable state when it acquires the lock.

Waiting state: The thread will be in waiting state when it calls wait() method or join() method. It will move to the runnable state when other thread will notify or that thread will be terminated.

Timed Waiting: A thread lies in a timed waiting state when it calls a method with a time-out parameter. A thread lies in this state until the timeout is completed or until a notification is received. For example, when a thread calls sleep or a conditional wait, it is moved to a timed waiting state.

Terminated State: A thread terminates because of either of the following reasons: 
Because it exits normally. This happens when the code of the thread has been entirely executed by the program.
Because there occurred some unusual erroneous event, like a segmentation fault or an unhandled exception.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

7. Discuss the difference between user-level threads and kernel-level threads.

User-level threads are managed by user-level libraries, offering fast context switching but blocking the entire process if one thread blocks, while kernel-level threads are managed by the operating system kernel, allowing true parallelism and better resource management, but with higher overhead. 

User-Level Threads:
Management: Managed by a thread library in user space, independent of the kernel. 
Context Switching: Fast and efficient, as it only involves switching user-level registers. 
Blocking: If one thread performs a blocking system call, the entire process blocks, even if other threads are ready to run. 

Parallelism: Doesn't offer true parallelism on multi-core systems, as only one thread can run at a time within a process. 

Resource Management: Less overhead for thread creation and management. 
Example: POSIX threads (Pthreads) can be implemented as user-level threads.
 
Kernel-Level Threads:

Management: Managed by the operating system kernel. 
Context Switching: Slower than user-level threads, as it involves kernel intervention.
 
Blocking: If one thread blocks, other threads in the same process can continue running. 

Parallelism: Allows true parallelism on multi-core systems, as multiple threads can run concurrently. 
Resource Management: More overhead for thread creation and management. 

Example: Windows threads, and Linux threads are kernel-level threads. 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

8. How can you create a thread in Java, and what are the different ways to achieve this?

In Java, you can create a thread by either extending the Thread class and overriding the run() method, or by implementing the Runnable interface and passing the implementing class to the Thread constructor, then calling start() to initiate the thread. 


1. Extending the Thread Class:
Create a subclass of Thread: Define a new class that extends the Thread class.
Override the run() method: Inside the subclass, override the run() method with the code that you want the thread to execute.
Instantiate and start the thread: Create an instance of your subclass and call the start() method to begin the thread's execution. 
Java

class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Code to be executed by the thread
        System.out.println("This is a thread running!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start(); // Start the thread
    }
}

2. Implementing the Runnable Interface:
Create a class that implements Runnable:
Define a class that implements the Runnable interface.
Override the run() method:
Inside the class, override the run() method with the code that you want the thread to execute.
Instantiate Thread and pass the Runnable object:
Create a Thread object, passing an instance of the Runnable class to its constructor.
Start the thread:
Call the start() method on the Thread object to begin the thread's execution. 
Java

ex-

class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Code to be executed by the thread
        System.out.println("This is a thread running!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyRunnable runnable = new MyRunnable();
        Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
        thread.start(); // Start the thread
    }
}
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


9. Explain the significance of the "run" method in a Java thread.

the run() method is crucial as it defines the code that a thread executes when it's started, and it's the method that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) calls to begin the thread's execution. 

Thread's Task:
The run() method contains the instructions that constitute the specific task or functionality that a thread is intended to perform. 

Starting the Thread:
When a thread is created (using Thread class or Runnable interface), the start() method is used to initiate the thread's execution. 

JVM's Role:
The start() method doesn't directly call the run() method; instead, it sets up the thread for execution, and the JVM then takes over, creating a new thread and calling the run() method within that new thread's context. 

Directly calling run():
Calling run() directly from the main thread, rather than using start(), will execute the run() method within the context of the main thread, not a new one. 

Example:


    class MyThread extends Thread {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            // Code to be executed by the thread
            System.out.println("Thread is running");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start(); // Start the thread
    }

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

10. What is the purpose of the "start" method in the context of multithreading?

In multithreading, the start() method initiates the execution of a thread by creating a new thread and invoking the run() method in that thread, allowing multiple parts of a program to run concurrently. 

start() method:
This method is used to initiate the execution of a thread. 
It creates a new thread and then calls the run() method within that thread. 
The start() method returns immediately, allowing the current thread to continue executing while the new thread runs concurrently. 
Attempting to call start() on a thread that has already been started will throw an IllegalThreadStateException. 

run() method:
This method contains the code that will be executed by the newly created thread. 
You define the tasks or operations that the thread will perform within the run() method. 

Concurrency:
Multithreading enables concurrent execution of tasks, making it easier to manage multiple tasks simultaneously. 
By using start() to create and initiate multiple threads, you can achieve parallel processing, improving application performance and responsiveness

11. Discuss the challenges and issues related to thread synchronization.

Thread synchronization, while crucial for managing concurrent access to shared resources, presents challenges like performance overhead, complexity, and the risk of issues such as deadlocks and race conditions. 

1. Performance Overhead:

Lock Contention:
Multiple threads competing for the same lock can lead to bottlenecks, especially in high-concurrency scenarios, slowing down execution.

Context Switching:
Threads waiting for locks can cause frequent context switching, which adds overhead.

Synchronization Mechanisms:
The overhead of synchronization mechanisms (like mutexes, semaphores) can impact performance. 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

12. Explain the concept of thread safety and why it is important.


Thread safety ensures that code, especially in multi-threaded environments, behaves correctly and predictably when accessed by multiple threads concurrently, preventing data corruption or unexpected behavior. It's crucial for reliable and stable applications. 

What is Thread Safety? 
Thread safety refers to the property of code that can be accessed and manipulated by multiple threads without causing data corruption or inconsistencies. 
In essence, a thread-safe program guarantees that no race conditions, data corruption, or inconsistent states occur during concurrent execution. 
A thread-safe function or object behaves correctly even when accessed from multiple threads, regardless of the scheduling or interleaving of the execution. 

Why is Thread Safety Important? 
Preventing Data Corruption: Without thread safety, multiple threads could access and modify shared data simultaneously, leading to unpredictable results and potentially corrupting the data. 
Ensuring Program Stability: Thread-safe code helps maintain the integrity and stability of a program, even in high-concurrency scenarios. 
Avoiding Race Conditions: Race conditions occur when the outcome of a program depends on the unpredictable order in which threads execute, leading to bugs that are difficult to debug. 
Maintaining Consistency: Thread-safe code ensures that shared data remains consistent across all threads, preventing unexpected behavior or errors.
 
How to Achieve Thread Safety? 
Synchronization Mechanisms: Using synchronization mechanisms like locks (mutexes) or atomic operations to control access to shared resources. 
Immutability: Making objects immutable (unchangeable after creation) can simplify thread safety, as multiple threads can safely access immutable objects without the risk of data corruption. 
Thread Confinement: Limiting access to shared data to a single thread, preventing race conditions by ensuring that only one thread can modify the data at a time. 
Stateless Objects: Designing objects that do not maintain any state can also contribute to thread safety, as they inherently do not require synchronization mechanisms. 

Examples of Thread Safety Issues: 
Incorrect Counter Updates: Multiple threads incrementing a shared counter without proper synchronization can lead to incorrect results. 
Race Conditions in File Access: Multiple threads attempting to write to the same file simultaneously can cause data corruption or loss. 
Inconsistent Data Structures: Concurrent access to mutable data structures without synchronization can lead to inconsistencies. 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

13. How can you synchronize methods and code blocks in Java?

In Java, you can synchronize a piece of code using the synchronized keyword. This keyword can be applied to methods or code blocks to ensure that only one thread can execute that code at a time.


Method Synchronization
In Java, method synchronization is achieved by adding the synchronized keyword. Then the entire method is treated as a critical section. Ensuring that only one thread can execute that method at any given time. This approach locks the entire method, preventing other threads from accessing it until the first thread finishes its execution.

ex-

// Multiple threads are executing on the same object 
// at same time without synchronization
import java.io.*;
class Line
{
    // if multiple threads(trains) will try to
    // access this unsynchronized method,
    // then object's  state will be corrupted
    public void getLine()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
        {
            System.out.println(i);
            try
            {
                Thread.sleep(100);
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                System.out.println(e);
            }
        }
    }
}

class Train extends Thread
{
    // shared object
    Line line;

    Train(Line line)
    {
      
        // Initialize shared object
        this.line = line;
    }

    @Override
    public void run()
    {
        // Access the getLine() method
        line.getLine();
    }
}

public class Geeks
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Shared Line object
        Line obj = new Line();

        // creating the threads that are
        // sharing the same Object
        Train t1 = new Train(obj);
        Train t2 = new Train(obj);

        // threads start their execution
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}


Block Synchronization
If we only need to execute some subsequent lines of code not all lines (instructions) of code within a method, then we should synchronize only block of the code within which required instructions are exists. For example, lets suppose there is a method that contains 100 lines of code but there are only 10 lines (one after one) of code which contain critical section of code i.e. these lines can modify (change) the Object’s state. So we only need to synchronize these 10 lines of code method to avoid any modification in state of the Object and to ensure that other threads can execute rest of the lines within the same method without any interruption.

ex-

// Demonstration of Block Synchronization
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

class Geek {
    String name = "";
    public int count = 0;

    // Method where only a block is synchronized
    public void geekName(String geek, List<String> list) {
      
        // Only one thread is allowed to change 
        // the geek's name at a time
        synchronized(this) {
            name = geek;
          
            // Keep track of how many threads 
            // have changed the name
            count++;  
        }

        // Other threads are allowed to add geek's 
        // name to the list concurrently
        list.add(geek);
    }
}

class GFG {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
      
        Geek gk = new Geek();
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
        gk.geekName("Mohit", list);
        System.out.println(gk.name);
    }
}

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

14. Discuss the use of the "join" method in multithreading.

In multithreading, the join() method allows one thread to wait for the completion of another thread's execution, ensuring that the calling thread doesn't proceed until the joined thread terminates. 

Purpose: The primary use of join() is synchronization in multithreaded programs. When a thread calls join() on another thread, the calling thread is suspended until the target thread completes its execution.

How it works:
The join() method is called on a Thread object.
The calling thread enters a waiting state until the target thread terminates.
Once the target thread completes, the calling thread resumes execution.


Example:

    // Create a new thread
    Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
        // Perform some task
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate some work
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println("Thread finished.");
    });

    // Start the thread
    thread.start();

    // Wait for the thread to complete
    try {
        thread.join();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

    // Continue execution after the thread completes
    System.out.println("Main thread continues...");

Benefits:
Ensuring order: join() guarantees that the calling thread will execute only after the joined thread has finished, which is crucial for tasks where the order of execution matters. 
Waiting for results: If a thread needs to wait for the results or completion of another thread, join() can be used to ensure that the waiting thread is blocked until the other thread is done.
 
Overloaded Methods:
join() has overloaded methods that allow you to specify a timeout in milliseconds or milliseconds and nanoseconds. 
join(): Waits indefinitely until the thread terminates. 
join(long millis): Waits for the specified number of milliseconds or until the thread terminates. 
join(long millis, int nanos): Waits for the specified number of milliseconds and nanoseconds, or until the thread terminates. 

InterruptedException:
If the waiting thread is interrupted while waiting for the target thread to terminate, the join() method throws an InterruptedException

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

15. Explain the significance of the "yield" method in the context of thread scheduling.

In thread scheduling, the yield() method is a hint to the scheduler, suggesting that the current thread is willing to relinquish its current use of the CPU, allowing other threads of the same or higher priority to run, but it doesn't guarantee that another thread will be scheduled. 

What it does:
When a thread calls yield(), it signals to the operating system (or JVM in the case of Java) that it's temporarily pausing its execution and is ready to allow other threads to run. 

Not a guarantee:
The scheduler is free to ignore the yield() hint and continue running the current thread, so there's no guarantee that another thread will be scheduled. 

Purpose:
The primary purpose of yield() is to improve the responsiveness of a multithreaded application by giving other threads a chance to execute, especially when the current thread is performing non-critical operations. 

Difference from sleep():
While sleep() causes a thread to pause for a specified duration, yield() is more of a temporary pause, and the thread might be resumed immediately by the scheduler. 

Considerations:
yield() is a hint, not a command. The scheduler might choose to ignore it, or it might choose to reschedule the current thread immediately. 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

16. What is the role of the "sleep" method in Java multithreading?

In Java multithreading, the Thread.sleep() method pauses the execution of the current thread for a specified duration (in milliseconds), allowing other threads to run, and then resumes execution from where it left off. 

Pausing Execution:
Thread.sleep() is a static method that suspends the execution of the thread that calls it. 

Time-Based Pause:
The sleep() method takes a long argument representing the number of milliseconds to pause the thread. 

Thread Resumption:
After the specified time elapses, the thread resumes execution from the point where it was paused. 

InterruptedException:
If another thread interrupts the sleeping thread, an InterruptedException is thrown, which needs to be handled (e.g., using a try-catch block). 

Non-Runnable State:
When a thread is sleeping, it enters a "non-runnable" state, meaning it's not actively executing code. 

Doesn't Release Locks:
Unlike the wait() method, sleep() does not release any locks held by the thread. 


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

17. Discuss the difference between preemptive and cooperative multitasking.

Preemptive Multitasking	
	
Preemptive multitasking is a task used by the OS to decide for how long a task should be executed before allowing another task to use the OS.
It interrupts applications and gives control to other processes outside the application’s control.	
The operating system can initiate context switch from a running process to another process.	
A malicious program initiates an infinite loop, it only hurts itself without affecting other programs or threads.
Preemptive multitasking forces applications to share the CPU whether they want to or not.
UNIX, Windows 95, Windows NT operating systems are examples of preemptive multitasking .	
	

Cooperative Multitasking

Cooperative multitasking is a type of computer multitasking in which the operating system never initiates a context switch from a running process to another process

In cooperative multitasking, process scheduler never interrupts a process unexpectedly.

The operating system does not initiate a context switch from a running process to another process.

A malicious program can bring the entire system to a halt by busy waiting or running an infinite loop and not giving up control

In cooperative multitasking, all programs must cooperate for it to work. If one program does not cooperate, it can hog the CPU.

Macintosh OS version 8.0-9.2.2 and Windows 3.x operating systems are examples of cooperative multitasking.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

18. How does the "interrupt" mechanism work in Java multithreading?

In Java multithreading, the interrupt mechanism uses an internal flag (interrupt status) to signal a thread to potentially stop or change its behavior, but it's a cooperative mechanism, meaning the thread being interrupted must check this flag and react accordingly. 

The interrupt() Method:
When a thread T1 calls interrupt() on another thread T2, it sets an internal flag (interrupt status) on T2. 

The isInterrupted() Method:
The isInterrupted() method checks the interrupt status flag of the current thread. It returns true if the flag is set, and false otherwise. 

The InterruptedException:
When a thread is waiting (e.g., in sleep(), wait(), join()), and its interrupt status is set, it will throw an InterruptedException. 

Cooperative Mechanism:
The interrupted thread is not forced to stop; it's up to the thread's code to check the interrupt status and react accordingly (e.g., by returning from the current method or breaking a loop). 
Example:


    Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
        try {
            while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) { // Check for interruption
                System.out.println("Thread is running...");
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate some work
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Thread interrupted");
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); // Restore interrupted status
        }
    });
    thread.start();

    // ... (later in the main thread)
    thread.interrupt(); // Signal the thread to stop


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

19. Explain the concept of deadlock and how it can be avoided in multithreaded
programs.

In multithreaded programming, a deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, each waiting for a resource held by another, creating a circular dependency. To avoid deadlocks, establish a consistent lock acquisition order, use timeouts, and avoid nested locks. 
Understanding Deadlock

Definition:
A deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for a resource held by another thread in the deadlock. 

Cause:
Deadlocks typically arise when threads acquire locks (or resources) in different orders, leading to a circular wait where no thread can proceed. 

Example:
Imagine two threads, Thread A and Thread B, both needing two locks, Lock 1 and Lock 2. Thread A acquires Lock 1, then waits for Lock 2, while Thread B acquires Lock 2, then waits for Lock 1. Neither thread can proceed because they are both blocked, waiting for a resource held by the other. 
Avoiding Deadlocks

Here are some strategies to prevent deadlocks in multithreaded programs:

Establish a Consistent Lock Acquisition Order:
Ensure all threads acquire locks in the same order. This prevents the circular wait condition where one thread is waiting for a lock held by another. 

Use Timeouts:
When a thread is waiting for a lock, set a timeout. If the lock isn't acquired within the timeout, the thread can release its own locks and retry, preventing indefinite blocking. 

Avoid Nested Locks:
Minimize the use of nested locks, where a thread holding a lock attempts to acquire another lock that is also held by another thread. 

Design for Mutual Exclusion:
Ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time, using techniques like mutexes or semaphores. 

Use Reentrant Locks:
Reentrant locks allow a thread to acquire the same lock multiple times without blocking itself, which can help avoid certain deadlock scenarios. 

Monitor for Deadlocks:
Implement mechanisms to detect deadlocks and take appropriate action, such as terminating the deadlocked threads or releasing resources. 

Use Lock Hierarchies:
Assign a strict order in which resources can be locked by tasks. This ensures that no task is waiting for a resource in an inconsistent order, reducing the chance of circular dependencies.

20. Discuss the use of the "volatile" keyword in the context of multithreading


In multithreading, the volatile keyword ensures that a variable's value is always read from main memory and not cached, guaranteeing visibility of changes across threads, preventing inconsistencies and data races. 

Purpose:
The volatile keyword is used to declare variables that are shared among multiple threads. It instructs the compiler and runtime environment that the value of the variable might be changed unexpectedly by other threads or external events. 

Visibility:
When a variable is declared as volatile, any change made to it by one thread is immediately visible to all other threads. This is because the compiler and runtime are prevented from caching the value of the variable in CPU registers or local memory, ensuring that every read operation fetches the most recent value from main memory. 

No Atomicity or Synchronization:
It's important to note that volatile only guarantees visibility; it doesn't provide atomicity or synchronization. If you need to ensure that multiple operations on a shared variable are performed atomically (as a single, indivisible unit), you should use synchronization mechanisms like synchronized blocks or explicit locks.
 
Use Cases:
Flag Variables: volatile is commonly used for flag variables (e.g., a boolean indicating whether a thread should continue running) to ensure that changes made by one thread are immediately visible to other threads. 
Shared Variables: When multiple threads access and modify a shared variable, volatile can help prevent unexpected behavior caused by cached values. 

Example (Java):


    private volatile boolean running = true; // Flag variable

    public void stop() {
        running = false; // Change visible to other threads
    }

    public void run() {
        while (running) {
            // Do some work
        }
    }
