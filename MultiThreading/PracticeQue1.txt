Solve by Using Thread class :


Q1.Given an array of N integers. Find the first element that occurs at least K number of times.
 
Example 1:
Input :
N = 7, K = 2
A[] = {1, 7, 4, 3, 4, 8, 7}
Output :
7


Q2.Given an array A of positive integers. Your task is to find the leaders in the array. An element of array is leader if it is greater than or equal to all the elements to its right side. The rightmost element is always a leader. 

Example 1:

Input:
n = 6
A[] = {16,17,4,3,5,2}
Output: 17 5 2



Q3.Given an array A of n positive numbers. The task is to find the first Equilibrium Point in an array. 
Equilibrium Point in an array is a position such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of elements after it.

Note: Retun the index of Equilibrium point. (1-based index)

Example 1:

Input: 
n = 5 
A[] = {1,3,5,2,2} 
Output: 3 





Q4.You are given two arrays, A and B, of equal size N. The task is to find the minimum value of A[0] * B[0] + A[1] * B[1] + .... + A[N-1] * B[N-1], where shuffling of elements of arrays A and B is allowed.


Example 1:
Input:
N = 3 
A[] = {3, 1, 1}
B[] = {6, 5, 4}
Output:
23
-------------------
Q5.Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 of size N and M respectively and an element K. The task is to find the element that would be at the kâ€™th position of the final sorted array.
 

Example 1:

Input:
arr1[] = {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
arr2[] = {1, 4, 8, 10}
k = 5
Output:
6


Q6.Given an array of size N filled with numbers from 1 to N-1 in random order. The array has only one repetitive element. The task is to find the repetitive element.

Examples:

Input: a[] = {1, 3, 2, 3, 4}
Output: 3
Q7.Given two unsorted arrays that represent two sets (elements in every array are distinct), find the union and intersection of two arrays.

Example: 

arr1[] = {7, 1, 5, 2, 3, 6} 
arr2[] = {3, 8, 6, 20, 7} 
Then your program should print Union as {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 20} and Intersection as {3, 6, 7}. Note that the elements of union and intersection can be printed in any order.



Q8.Given three arrays sorted in non-decreasing order, print all common elements in these arrays.

Examples: 

Input: 
ar1[] = {1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80} 
ar2[] = {6, 7, 20, 80, 100} 
ar3[] = {3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120} 
Output: 20, 80


Q9.Given an array of integers. All numbers occur twice except one number which occurs once. Find the number 
Example : 

Input:  arr[] = {2, 3, 5, 4, 5, 3, 4}
Output: 2 


Q10.Given an array arr[] of integers, segregate even and odd numbers in the array. Such that all the even numbers should be present first, and then the odd numbers.

Examples:  

Input: arr[] = 1 9 5 3 2 6 7 11
Output: 2 6 5 3 1 9 7 11
