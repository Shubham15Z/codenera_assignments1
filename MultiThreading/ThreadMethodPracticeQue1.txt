1. Write a program where a thread prints numbers from 1 to 5, with a 1-second delay between each print using sleep.  
2. Create a program where multiple threads print their names but pause for different durations using sleep.  
3. Implement a thread that simulates a countdown timer from 10 to 1, with a 500ms delay between numbers.  
4. Write a program where two threads print alternate numbers from 1 to 10 with sleep delays.  
5. Implement a program that simulates a progress bar using sleep where a dot is printed every second.  
6. Write a program where a thread sleeps for 3 seconds and then prints a message.  
7. Create a thread that prints "Processing..." every second for 5 times.  
8. Implement a thread that pauses execution using sleep for a random time between 1-5 seconds before printing a message.  
9. Create a thread that prints numbers, but if it is interrupted while sleeping, it should handle the exception and print "Interrupted" instead.  
10. Implement a stopwatch simulation where a thread prints elapsed seconds indefinitely until the user interrupts it.  
11. Write a program where one thread waits for another thread to finish using join.  
12. Implement a program where three threads execute sequentially using join, ensuring Thread-1 finishes before Thread-2 starts and so on.  
13. Create a program where the main thread waits for three child threads to complete before printing "All threads finished!".  
14. Write a program where a thread prints a message, waits for another thread using join, and then continues execution.  
15. Implement a program where multiple threads are started, and the main thread prints a final message only after all threads complete.  
16. Create a task execution simulation where a worker thread must complete before the next worker starts.  
17. Implement a program where one thread fetches data, and another thread processes it after fetching is complete using join.  
18. Write a program where multiple threads start simultaneously, but each waits for the previous thread to finish using join.  
19. Create a program where the main thread starts 3 worker threads and waits for the fastest one to finish before continuing execution.  
20. Implement a program where three threads represent different stages of a project, and one stage must complete before the next begins.  
21. Write a program where three threads have different priorities and observe the execution order.  
22. Implement a program where one thread has MAX_PRIORITY, another has MIN_PRIORITY, and check their execution.  
23. Create a thread that prints "High Priority" more frequently than "Low Priority" using priority.  
24. Write a program where a thread prints its default priority, then changes it to 8, and prints the updated priority.  
25. Implement a program where multiple threads execute with the same priority and check if execution order is consistent.  
26. Write a program where one thread changes the priority of another thread dynamically while it's running.  
27. Create a program where a thread inherits the priority from the main thread and prints it.  
28. Implement a program where multiple threads with different priorities are started inside a loop, checking their behavior.  
29. Write a program where a high-priority thread sleeps for 3 seconds, and a low-priority thread executes during that time.  
30. Create a simulation where five threads have different priorities and measure how many times each executes within a time limit.
