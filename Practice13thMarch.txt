1.Given an array arr[] of integers. Find a peak element i.e. an element that is not smaller than its neighbors. 
   Note: For corner elements, we need to consider only one neighbor. 
   Example:
   Input: array[]= {5, 10, 20, 15}
   Output: 20
   Explanation: The element 20 has neighbors 10 and 15, both of them are less than 20.
2.Given an array A of size N of integers. Your task is to find the minimum and maximum elements in the array.
 
   Example 1:
   Input:
   N = 6
   A[] = {3, 2, 1, 56, 10000, 167}
   Output:
   min = 1, max =  10000

3.Given an array (or string), the task is to reverse the array/string.
  Examples : 
 Input  : arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
 Output : arr[] = {3, 2, 1}

4.Given an array arr[] of size N, the task is to sort this array in ascending order in C.
   Examples: 
   Input: arr[] = {0, 23, 14, 12, 9}
   Output: {0, 9, 12, 14, 23}
5.Given an array and a number K where K is smaller than the size of the array. Find the K’th smallest element in the given array. 
  Given that all array elements are distinct.
  Examples:  
  Input: arr[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15}, K = 3 
  Output: 7

6.Given a sorted array arr[] and a number x, write a function that counts the occurrences of x in arr[].
  Expected time complexity is O(Logn) 
  Examples: 
  Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3,},   x = 2
  Output: 4 // x (or 2) occurs 4 times in arr[]
7.Given an array A[] consisting of only 0s, 1s, and 2s. The task is to write a function that sorts the given array. 
  The functions should put all 0s first, then all 1s and all 2s in last.

  This problem is also the same as the famous “Dutch National Flag problem”. 
  The problem was proposed by Edsger Dijkstra. The problem is as follows:
  Given N balls of colour red, white or blue arranged in a line in random order. 
  You have to arrange all the balls such that the balls with the same colours are adjacent with the order of the balls, 
  with the order of the colours being red, white and blue (i.e., all red coloured balls come first then the white coloured
  balls and then the blue coloured balls). 

  Examples:
  Input: {0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2}
  Output: {0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2}

8.Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers and an integer sum, find a subarray that adds to a given sum.
  Note: There may be more than one subarray with sum as the given sum, print first such subarray. 
  Examples: 
  Input: arr[] = {1, 4, 20, 3, 10, 5}, sum = 33
  Output: Sum found between indexes 2 and 4
9.An array contains both positive and negative numbers in random order. Rearrange the array elements so that all negative 
  numbers appear before all positive numbers.
  Examples : 
  Input: -12, 11, -13, -5, 6, -7, 5, -3, -6
  Output: -12 -13 -5 -7 -3 -6 11 6 5

10..Given two sorted arrays, find their union and intersection.
  Example:
  Input: arr1[] = {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}
        arr2[] = {2, 3, 5, 6} 
  Output: Union : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} 
         Intersection : {3, 5}
